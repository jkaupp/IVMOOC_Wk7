Building a ShinyApp for #IVMOOC week 7 assignment

I wasn't happy with just using Seadragon according to the course and textbook, as it was really straightforward.  So I decided to go off an explore d3.js in R and create an interactive visualization.

This lead to exploring many tools: rCharts, ggvis, htmlwidgets, networkD3, Shiny and ShinyApps

Was a great ride, and I fully intend to use this example to work on bits and pieces in the future.
